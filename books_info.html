This book is a humanitarian contribution from the Society for Assistance International (SAI) and the SAI Institute of Educare, with the intention of preventing child trauma and consequent neurodevelopmental and physical disorders.This book is the result of my passion to reach out to all and ensure that every child is born to give something back to society.

They will be happy to move away from old theories on raising an infant and will eagerly self-educate to develop the skills to be an effective parent.

Therefore, he ended up in the Nazi extermination camp. But he escaped both Hitler and death. With his story, Emerich Roth wants to show the incredible power that man possesses. How he can rise from the worst humiliation. And that from the most terrible situations she can develop something positive. Emerich himself is a living example. His story of how he survived the Holocaust is partly black at night, but his outlook on life is bright and optimistic. After fighting for his life in the worst of experiences, he has since dedicated his life to fighting violence, racism and oppression.
